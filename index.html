        What is Scale?
        </h3>
        
        <p>
        Scale gives us the ability to take given datasets domain and transfer that information into another
            datasets specific range. We typically see such a need in units especially when drawing charts, 
            images, etc. Certain specifications of these items dont exactly line up with their counterparts
            so an ability to convert such units is neccessary and that is where scale comes in to play.
        </p>
        
        <h3>
        How is Scale Useful?
        </h3>
        
        <p>
        <ol>
            <li> 
                Scale can be used on gigantic number sets such that it shrinks the data set to working size but
                maintains all its features and values just smaller such that the visualizations stay true throughout.
            </li>
            <li>
                Scales can be used to change the dimensions of a visual element inside of the already scaled item. It
                is not neccessary to refer to the old data set as the scaled version maintains the same features.
